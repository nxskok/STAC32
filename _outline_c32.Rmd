## In this course
- Data analysis: use mostly known (to you) statistical methods to gain
insight about data.
- Use two software packages, SAS and R — I assume you know nothing
about these.
- Look at lots of examples.
- “Get your hands dirty”.
- Writing reports.
- Other tasks in R and SAS.

## Prerequisites

- This course is part of the Applied Statistics Minor program.
- This course is *not* part of the Statistics Minor/Major/Specialist programs; you *do not* receive credit for this course in those programs (you should take STAC33 instead).
- You need a second Statistics course that covers statistical inference, one of these:
  - STAB27
  - MGEB12
  - PSYC08
- STAB52 and STAB57 is *not* suitable preparation for this course.
- I check prerequisites.

## STAC53

- Check your Degree Explorer.
- This might have STAC50 as a requirement (for which you don't now have the prereq)
- If you have not already taken C50, you need to take *STAC53*.
- To get this reflected in your Degree Explorer: email me `ken.butler@utoronto.ca`:
   - with your name and student number
   - and explaining that you would like me to make this change.

- This course is on Quercus. Go [**here**](http://q.utoronto.ca), log in, and find
this course among your courses. Assignment hand-in, grading and
marks will be done through Quercus.
- E-mail: Use only UTSC/UToronto e-mail address. I aim to respond
within two working days. Non-simple questions: office hours/tutorial.

## Structure of course
- 3 hours/week of class time.
- Of these, 1 hour in computer lab (“tutorial”):
  - practice what you learned from lecture
  - you can work on your assignment or on the additional problems listed there.
  - Get help if needed (instructor/TA available)

## Course material
For each of R (first) and then SAS:

- Installation / connection
- Reading data files (of different sorts)
- Making graphs
- Numerical summaries
- Statistical inference
- Reports
- Tidying and organizing data
- Case studies
- Functions / arrays
- Dates and times
- Miscellaneous tasks




## Laptop use
- If you have a laptop, you may find it useful for following along with
the use of the software or for taking notes.
- Checking social media or other non-course-specific activity during
class distracts from your learning. If you are going to get the most
from this course, you need to pay full attention in class. Multi-tasking
will not help you.
- Using your laptop for non-course activity will also distract those
around you and creates a worse learning experience for everybody. If
somebody’s inappropriate laptop use is distracting you, let me know. I
will create laptop-free zones in class if necessary.

## Assessment


 \begin{tabular}{p{3.5in}r}
    \hline
    Item & Weight\\
    \hline
    Assignments (most weeks after first). Can study with classmates, but what you hand in must
    be \textbf{entirely your own work}. Due Thursdays at 11:59pm. & 15\\
    \hline
    Midterm exam, 2 hours, open book (see over) & 30\\
    \hline
    Group data analysis report (1--5 people/group). Data analysis on data set of your choosing,
    using R/SAS/both, report written as described in class.
    Due last
    day of classes at 11:59pm. & 10 \\
    \hline
    Final exam, 3 hours, open book (see over). \textbf{You must pass
    the final exam to guarantee passing the course.} & 45\\
    \hline
    Total & 100\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

## Open book, defined
“Open book” means these are permissible, written/printed versions only: 

- the SAS text
- the R text
- my lecture notes
- assignments, yours (graded) and mine (with solutions)
- any other notes that you have made in this course.

Old exams are not permitted.

## Missed work and documentation
- No make-up assignments or tests in this course.
- Work handed in late may or may not be accepted (instructor’s
discretion; instructor’s decision is final).
- If you miss assessed work due to illness/injury, complete form 
[**here**](http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca/)
and submit to instructor within 10 working days of due date.
- Weight of missed work with appropriate documentation transferred to
other assessments of same type.

## Academic integrity
- Read and understand [**this**](http://www.utoronto.ca/academicintegrity/).
- Academic dishonesty devalues your degree and those of all other
students.
- Cheating and plagiarism taken very seriously.
- Examples of academic offences:
- Using someone else’s words/ideas without acknowledgement.
- Obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on an assignment.
- On test/exam, looking at someone else’s answers or allowing someone
else to look at yours.
- Pretending to be someone else.
- Falsifying or altering required documentation (eg. doctor’s notes).

## Penalties
- Penalties include (depending on seriousness of offence) a mark of zero
for the work concerned, a mark of zero for the entire course, or
suspension/expulsion from the University.
- Penalties are (much) more severe for those caught a second (or third)
time.
- “Students who cheat and are not caught will be haunted by the
memory of their misdeeds for the rest of their miserable lives.” (From 
[here](https://philosophy.osu.edu/sites/philosophy.osu.edu/files/1100%20Brown_2.pdf).)
