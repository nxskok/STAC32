# Applications of Statistical Methods

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg){width=400px}

Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

In this course, we learn R (and later SAS), and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know.

This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean *in the context of the data you are working with*: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. In real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.

## News

- 2019-09-12 11:00: reminder: today's class, and all the remaining Thursday lectures, are in **IC 130**.

- 2019-09-09 17:00: on the agenda for this week: numerical summaries (short), the first part of statistical inference (long). I'm aiming to show you the one-sample inference stuff in R this week (that is, one-sample $t$ confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, for estimating a population mean). You ought to be very familiar with the ideas here, but I want to make sure that you really are, along of course with how to code it in R.

- 2019-09-09 16:45: draft of [Assignment 2](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/assgt_data/a2.pdf), which will be due on Thursday 19th.

- 2019-09-09 13:00: The Thursday lecture will now be in *IC 130* (effective now, for the rest of the semester). You are likely to find some other class happening in the old room.

- 2019-09-09 12:45: I've been looking at the wait list, and have chosen to admit three more students. My criteria were: must be in the Statistics Applied Minor program, must not simultaneously be in any conflicting program (such as Statistics Major or Minor), *and* must have joined the wait list on or before Wednesday of last week. All of those. My reasons for doing it this way:
  - the course is required for the Statistics Applied Minor, so I need to give these students priority as far as I can.
  - students simultaneously in the Applied Minor and some other Statistics program need to choose *one* of those programs, because the programs require courses that are exclusions to each other (and therefore such students run the risk of not having enough distinct credits to graduate). This will be expressly forbidden as of next year.
  - Students in other Statistics programs (Specialist, Major, Minor) *do not get program credit* for this course, so there is no way I am admitting such students to the course.
  - Students in eg. Math Specialist can theoretically take this course (logically, they shouldn't be able to, which will be fixed for next year), but I have to give the Applied Minor students preference. (For Math Specialist students, the course is elective, not required.)
  - I want students in other disciplines who are on the wait list to be able to take this course if it looks as if they will be able to benefit from it, but this year there are too many Applied Minor students to be able to admit any students in other disciplines off the wait list. I feel bad about this, but unfortunately it's the way it is.
  - If you joined the wait list some time after the course has already begun, I question how serious you are about really wanting to get into it. (If you are in the third or fourth year, your registration window opens earlier, something you would do well to take advantage of when choosing programs and courses.)

- 2019-09-05 10:20: STAC32 only offers program credit for the Statistics *Applied* Minor. There are 10 people currently enrolled in the course who are in the Statistics Major/Minor/Specialist programs. A second warning to those people that you *will not* get program credit for STAC32. This applies no matter when you enrolled in your subject post. If you have spoken to me and understand the consequences, you may stay in the course, but otherwise your best option is to withdraw from the course. (This also applies if you are in these programs and are on the wait list; even if you get in, you won't get program credit for the course.) If this is you: there are some people on the wait list who would benefit from taking the course, and *you are preventing them from getting in*.

- 2019-09-04 20:45: I just took a quick look through the "Assignment 0" that were "handed in" (that is way too many quotes). If you got a "yep" comment from me, I saw the HTML output from the mtcars analysis. If I didn't see that, I tried to direct you towards what would work for next time. 
- 2019-09-04 20:00: here is [assignment 1](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/a1.pdf). This will be due on Thursday September 12 at 11:59pm. I am hoping to get through everything you need in tomorrow's lecture (we have to talk about reading in files and drawing graphs). The general principle is supposed to be that you'll be able to do each assignment after the preceding Thursday's lecture. Next week's tutorial is a chance for you to work on Assignment 1, either the hand-in problem or any of the related things in [PASIAS](http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/) (see problem 1 on assignment 1). There is an Assignment 1 link on Quercus where you can submit your Assignment 1 when it is done.
- 2019-09-03 17:30: as we solve one problem, another comes up: if you are registered for STAD29 and STAC53, you get a message on Degree Explorer that these courses are exclusions, which they are not. This will get fixed in the next round of curriculum changes, and so will be in place in time for you to graduate. Thus, don't worry about this now.
- 2019-09-03 16:00: the Quercus page is up. There isn't much there yet (apart from a link to here), but it is up.
- 2019-09-03 15:00: as I didn't get the chance to say at the end of lecture today: first tutorial *tomorrow*.
- 2019-09-03 11:15: first lecture is *today* and first tutorial is *tomorrow*.
- 2019-08-29 14:50: [How to write an email to your instructor](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M9abrkPN7-tmujhcCuUa2DlnxApfDBIKZlNgBRq-amM/edit#slide=id.p3). (This applies to any course you might be taking; adjust the instructor's name and course code appropriately.)
- 2019-08-26 13:30: Course info:
  - lectures Tuesday 1:00-2:00pm in MW 170, Thursday 12:00-1:00pm in SW 319.
  - tutorial one of Wednesday 3:00-4:00pm, 4:00-5:00pm in BV 498.
  - tutorials start in *week 1*. In the first tutorial you will work on ["Assignment 0"](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/assgt_data/a0.pdf).
  - office hours in IC 471 after class on Tuesday (14:00-15:30) and before class on Thursday (10:30-11:30).
  - course outline in first few pages of [here](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf). When you come to the first lecture, you will learn why I arrange things as I do.
- 2019-08-26 13:30: Welcome to STAC32! This website should now be live. Let me know if anything is not working.
