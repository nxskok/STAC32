# Applications of Statistical Methods

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg){width=400px}

Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).

In this course, we learn R (and later SAS), and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know.

This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean *in the context of the data you are working with*: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. In real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.

## News

- 2019-09-04 20:45: I just took a quick look through the "Assignment 0" that were "handed in" (that is way too many quotes). If you got a "yep" comment from me, I saw the HTML output from the mtcars analysis. If I didn't see that, I tried to direct you towards what would work for next time. 
- 2019-09-04 20:00: here is [assignment 1](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/a1.pdf). This will be due on Thursday September 12 at 11:59pm. I am hoping to get through everything you need in tomorrow's lecture (we have to talk about reading in files and drawing graphs). The general principle is supposed to be that you'll be able to do each assignment after the preceding Thursday's lecture. Next week's tutorial is a chance for you to work on Assignment 1, either the hand-in problem or any of the related things in [PASIAS](http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/) (see problem 1 on assignment 1). There is an Assignment 1 link on Quercus where you can submit your Assignment 1 when it is done.
- 2019-09-03 17:30: as we solve one problem, another comes up: if you are registered for STAD29 and STAC53, you get a message on Degree Explorer that these courses are exclusions, which they are not. This will get fixed in the next round of curriculum changes, and so will be in place in time for you to graduate. Thus, don't worry about this now.
- 2019-09-03 16:00: the Quercus page is up. There isn't much there yet (apart from a link to here), but it is up.
- 2019-09-03 15:00: as I didn't get the chance to say at the end of lecture today: first tutorial *tomorrow*.
- 2019-09-03 11:15: first lecture is *today* and first tutorial is *tomorrow*.
- 2019-08-29 14:50: [How to write an email to your instructor](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M9abrkPN7-tmujhcCuUa2DlnxApfDBIKZlNgBRq-amM/edit#slide=id.p3). (This applies to any course you might be taking; adjust the instructor's name and course code appropriately.)
