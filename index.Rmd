# Applications of Statistical Methods

## Ken Butler

Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean *in the context of the data you are working with*: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight; this course is about a lot more than "getting the answer".
In real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.

- 2020-08-17 16:15: I have been spending the summer trying to work out how to run this course online. I think I finally have something I'm happy with. Details, and my reasons for them, are in [the course outline](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/outline_c32_slides.pdf). Highlights:
  - 2 hours of recorded (by me) lectures per week, watch when you like.
  - 1.5 hours of real-time tutorial per week (on Zoom), where you can work through problems and ask questions with the TAs and myself available to help.
  - assessment: weekly (approx) assignments (drop worst 2) and a final project. To get an A grade you will need to average "good" work as described in the course outline. The graders will give you feedback on how you can make your future work better.
