# Applications of Statistical Methods

## Ken Butler

![bad picture](ken.jpg)

Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca).


This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean *in the context of the data you are working with*: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. Be prepared to show your understanding and insight; this course is about a lot more than "getting the answer".
In real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.

- 2020-09-05 17:15: weekly plan for you:
  - Monday:
    - (if there was an assignment due Sunday night) read through my solutions to the assignment you just handed in, and read through your graded assignment when you get it back, paying  particular attention to the comments. 
  - Tuesday: 
    - watch Tuesday's lecture (the odd-numbered one for the week). This should be up by about lunchtime.
    - start work on the PASIAS problems from the lecture 
  - Wednesday: 
    - see where you are having trouble with material from Tuesday's and last Thursday's lectures (after week 1), or with the PASIAS problems
    - bring these questions to tutorial. Be prepared to share your screen so that we can see where you got to.
  - Thursday:
    - watch Thursday's lecture, which should be up around lunchtime
    - if you have time, start work on the PASIAS problems from the lecture
  - Friday through Sunday: 
    - pick a three-hour time-slot to work on the week's assignment.
    - the assignment becomes available on Friday at 00:01, and is due on Sunday at 11:59pm
    - once you start the assignment, you have 3 hours to complete it.

- 2020-09-04 15:15: I met with my TAs this morning, and I think we have hashed out a system for tutorials:
  - these will be on Zoom. I will publicize the address later.
  - join the main room with your sound and (if you prefer) video off.
  - if you have a question, "raise your hand" in Zoom (click Participants, and look for it at the bottom. If you don't see it, use one of the others). One of us will invite you to a breakout room to discuss your question. If it is a computer-related question, it might help to share your screen; you can do this without having video enabled.
  - you can also use the chat if you like; we will be keeping an eye on that, but it may take a minute to get to a chat question.
  - the first tutorial will get you started with R and R Studio via `rstudio.cloud`. The problems you'll be doing are [here](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/a0.pdf); you can take a look ahead of time if you like, but this will probably make more sense after Lecture 1 (next Tuesday). **The first tutorial is in week 1**, on September 9.

- 2020-09-04 15:00: I somehow forgot to mention [PASIAS](http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/), a collection of Problems and Solutions in Applied Statistics, with answers (and additional comment). I will suggest some problems from here to work through in later tutorials. (The first tutorial is different. I'll get to that in a minute.)

- 2020-09-04 13:10: I made [a video](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/163918/pages/week-1?module_item_id=1628880) in which I add a bit more to [the course outline](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/outline_c32_slides.pdf), including some more of my reasons for things. You might need to log in to see the video if you use the direct link. By way of organization, I made a [Module](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/163918/modules) in [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca) to hold all the videos, and within that there is a Page for every week. The actual lectures, the ones that talk about the course material, will be numbered from 1 to 24 and I will include what they are about in the video title, so that you can find what you are looking for. The video I made yesterday is really a preamble to the course, so I called it Lecture 0.

- 2020-08-17 16:15: I have been spending the summer trying to work out how to run this course online. I think I finally have something I'm happy with. Details, and my reasons for them, are in [the course outline](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/outline_c32_slides.pdf). Highlights:
  - 2 hours of recorded (by me) lectures per week, watch when you like.
  - 1.5 hours of real-time tutorial per week (on Zoom), where you can work through problems and ask questions with the TAs and myself available to help.
  - assessment: weekly (approx) assignments (drop worst 2) and a final project. To get an A grade you will need to average "good" work as described in the course outline. The graders will give you feedback on how you can make your future work better.
