<p>Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on <a href="http://q.utoronto.ca">Quercus</a>.</p>
<p>In this course, we learn R (and later SAS), and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know.</p>
<p>This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean <em>in the context of the data you are working with</em>: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. In real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>2019-12-24 13:00: 8(b) done. I have to go organize Christmas now.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-23 21:30: 8(a) done. Enough for tonight. Might get some more done tomorrow, but I have to do things like wrapping presents as well.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-23 18:20: 5(b) done. Only question 8 left.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-23 16:00: question 6 done. Considering what’s still to go, it doesn’t look like grades before Christmas. Maybe the 27th. Going for a stroll in the sunshine.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-23 15:00: 6(c) done (around practicing the ukulele chords to “Always Remember Us This Way”. And lunch.) Doing 6(d) next while I have SAS on my mind.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-23 13:30: 6(b) done (around last-minute shopping).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-23 10:30: 6(a) done (while eating breakfast).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 22:30: 5(a) is done. Looking ahead (meaning, to tomorrow, since that is where I stop tonight): there is 5(b), 6 is SAS code (so ought to be fast), 7 is done, and 8 has four parts of which the last is likely to be a nightmare to mark. I may start with question 6 and build up to the rest of it.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 21:10: I’m through 1(e). There were a few really insightful answers.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 19:15: dinner cooking, and question 4 done. I fear I may have to tackle 1(e) next. <a href="final.pdf">My solutions</a> are being updated as I go.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 18:30: I found some apple crumble that needed finishing. 4(g) done. Time to get dinner started, so that I’m not ravenous again by the time it’s ready.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 17:00: 4(f) done. Hungry. What do I have to eat?</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 16:30: the walk and 4(e) done, at the speed of light (the latter, not the former).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 15:20: 4(d) done. Going for a walk while the sun is still shining.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 12:55: 4(c) done. I thought this would be a fast question. Sometime I have to tackle 1(e), which is likely <em>not</em> to be fast.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 12:05: 4(a) done (not too hard to grade, in the end).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-22 11:00: 4(b) done (I wanted to start with a fast one).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-21 22:55: question 3 done. Now playing: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdU5MQKDXsk">The Enid</a>. I first heard this on a Friday night heavy metal radio show (though it’s not exactly heavy metal) in about 1983. I was blown away by it then, and still am. I can feel myself slowing down, so I think I stop there for tonight. Questions 4, 5, 6 and 8 to go. I’ll start with question 4 tomorrow, which is lots of R coding, so ought to go fast.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-21 21:45: 3(b) done (working backwards). May be a late night tonight. On to 3(d). Now playing: Alberic Magnard’s Symphony No. 5. (I seem to need music to keep myself going.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-21 19:30: I finished the rest of 3(c). Now I really <em>do</em> need dinner.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-21 19:10: the Mood median test from 3(c) checked (fast work). I need dinner now, and then will work on the code for the ANOVAs.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-21 17:45: I finally made it through question 7. I think I need to find some nice simple code to mark next; 7(g) was hard work (and a lot of half points). There may also have been a ukulele break in the middle. I am currently trying to play along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWFeUNyfpmM">this</a>, which has a lot of funky minor chords (F minor hurts my fingers).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-21 13:30: 7(f) done. There were some approaches I wasn’t expecting, that I discuss in <a href="final.pdf">my solutions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-21 12:40: 7(e) is done. Pretty fast, but it took me a while to get started.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-20 22:45: 7(d) is done, which is all my brain can manage tonight. Also, updated <a href="final.pdf">solutions</a>, with a bit of pre-emptive extra for 7(e). I’ll start with that tomorrow, hoping that most of you will get a fast one mark for that.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-20 17:50: 7(c) is done. I’m going home. More later, but there needs to be dinner first.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-20 17:00: update: Aasha has graded question 1 (apart from (e), which I am doing) and 3(a). Bo is working on question 2. I am working on 7(c) right now (it’s been a slow day). On your exam (when you get it), you will see either comments explaining what was missing, or annotation of what was right and what was not, or at the very least a mark, and you’ll be able to see in the <a href="final.pdf">solutions</a> how many marks there were for what.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-20 13:45: I’ll be updating <a href="final.pdf">my exam solutions</a> as we go with marking. At the end, when I send you your marked final exam, you’ll be able to see why you lost any points you did.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-20 12:00: we are grading. Aasha is working on question 1, Bo on question 2, and I am on question 7 right now. PS: I have <em>one</em> airpod that was left behind at the exam. If it’s yours and you want it back, you can come find me in January.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-19 12:00: reminder reminder: final exam <em>this afternoon</em> in HLB 101.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-17 12:30: reminder that the final exam is <em>Thursday</em> 2:00-5:00pm in HLB 101 (same room as midterm).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-14 21:00: scheduled times for pre-exam office hours (in my office): Monday 16th, 2:00-4:00; Wednesday 18th 2:30-4:30.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-13 20:30: there will be pre-exam office hours next week: Wednesday afternoon, and either Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning, depending how the weekend works out.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-09 16:30: I am happy with your exam: 8 questions on 12 pages (plus a blank page in case you need extra space), 111 points. Four questions on R and four on SAS.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-05 17:45: the project grades are up. Everyone in a group should have the same mark; if your mark is different from the others in your group, or is missing and your group handed something in, let me know by email with your name and student number, and the name of the person who handed the work in (so that I can match you with the correct group).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-05 15:00: I think I am done grading. Next, to copy the marks to everyone else in a group before I release them. There may need to be tea involved.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-05 14:00: it looks as if I have looked at all the housing ones. Now for the NFL wins and any other miscellaneous ones.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-04 21:45: I think I’m out of energy for tonight. I have graded the NFL quarterback rating projects, along with the education and vocabulary scores ones, and one extra one that I was interested to see how it came out. Tomorrow, the house prices plus the NFL wins (I think that’s all I have left). I have something else in the morning, so will get to these in the afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-04 20:00: back to work after a slow afternoon. I have graded the (four?) “crowding” projects. I think I have a number of projects on house prices, a few on football things, and assorted others left to go.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-04 15:45: the wine projects and the First Crush ones are done. I will release the grades when all the projects are graded and I have recorded the marks for everyone on a project team.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-04 12:40: currently grading projects. (There are a couple that are late, with permission, that I will grade when I get them; I expect that I will otherwise grade projects that have reached me by now.) At the moment, I am working through the Pinot Noir ones (a popular choice). I think the second most popular choice was the house prices one. In my comments, I am trying to mention something that could have been better, and if I especially liked something, a comment on that as well. I have given one 9/10 so far, and I think I am being more generous with the 8/10s than I sometimes am.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-12-02 12:00: as the final exam stands now, 8 questions for 110 points on 13 pages (the last of which is blank in case you need more space). I’m trying to leave enough space for you to write your answers and maybe even to change your mind partway through an answer. Hence 13 pages rather than something like 11.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-29 11:45: the assignment 8 marks are up. This was my mistake: the assignments had been graded but I had to release the grades to you, which I have now done. Sorry.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-28 17:45: As I write this, riding the bus home. I’ve been working on your exam. It now has 8 questions for a total of 110 points, which I think is about the right length (it’s about 30% longer than the midterm was, but you’ll have 50% more time). It looks as if you would benefit from having a calculator at the exam. There will need to be editing before I send it for printing. I’m trying to get on with this now before I have all your projects to read through!</p></li>
<li>2019-11-28 15:10: I forgot to remind you to fill out a course evaluation for our course. There are a number of reasons to do so:
<ul>
<li>to help yourself: reflecting on your experience in the course will help you to get more out of it</li>
<li>to help students who come after you: the comment you make will help to make this a better course in the future</li>
<li>to help me: if you really liked (or disliked) the course, what you say will have an impact on my departmental review next year.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-11-25 15:45: looking further ahead still: our final exam is December 19, in the afternoon. Look out for some office hours on the 17th or 18th. I will announce some times closer to the date. I am likely also around before then.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-25 15:30: Stuff from <a href="pasi.sas.pdf">PASI-SAS</a> to look at: section 8 on ANOVA, problems 9.2-10.3 on ANOVA and Mood’s median test, problem 10.4 on selection of rows and columns, problem 10.5 on tidying data, problem 10.6 and section 11 on regression. I have to reorganize my section headings. Looking further ahead, section 12 is on regression with categorical variables (which I will get to on Thursday) and section 13 is on dates and times and other miscellaneous stuff, which I probably won’t get to.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-26 13:00: for this week, we look at data tidying in SAS, plus our regression case study.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-18 16:20: in PASI-SAS, sections 6 and 7 are worth working through now.</p></li>
<li>2019-11-18 09:30: on the slate for this week, in SAS, this (or as far as we get):
<ul>
<li>sign test</li>
<li>confidence interval for median</li>
<li>matched pairs</li>
<li>normal quantile plot</li>
<li>matched pairs sign test</li>
<li>Mood’s median test</li>
<li>ANOVA</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also (this week or next) show you how to do the variations on ANOVA that we saw before in R.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-17 12:45: with my customary lateness, here are <a href="a8.pdf">my solutions to assignment 8</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-15 12:40: there is no assignment due next week, so there are <em>no tutorials</em> next week either. I will be in my office if you need me for anything. Concerning the following week: I imagine that on November 27 you will be working on your projects, so we will in BV 498 as usual on that day.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-15 12:30: <a href="pasi-sas.pdf">PASI-SAS</a> updated, with proper section headings. Let me know of anything in there that is still confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-15 11:45: we have covered a lot of ground in SAS this week. This means you can tackle the problems in sections 3, 4, and 5 of <a href="pasi-sas.pdf">PASI-SAS</a>. I have some editing to do in PASI-SAS: I have to give the sections less dopey names, and in one or two places it says “hand in the next problem”, which you should ignore.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-15 11:30: because it’s the last assignment (and I feel like being a nice guy), I’ll accept any assignments that reach Quercus by <em>4:00pm today</em>. My solutions will probably go up sometime Saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-13 14:30: the grades for assignment 7 are posted. Be aware that the grading on this kind of assignment is very subjective, and that the grader has done their best to be consistent between assignments (that is, the same kind of work gets the same kind of mark regardless of who submitted it). If you want to request a regrade of anything, you can go ahead, but unless there has been an actual mistake in the grading, your mark is unlikely to change. <a href="a7.pdf">My solutions</a> show you the kind of thing I was expecting. If you went wrong part of the way through, the grader tried hard not to punish you for further mistakes beyond the first one. (If you lost more marks than that, there were further errors or you were inconsistent with yourself; for example, you said one thing and then your next step would have been right if you had said something else.)</p></li>
<li>2019-11-12 10:30: <a href="project.pdf">Project instructions here</a>. In brief:
<ul>
<li>work in a group of up to six people (chosen by you)</li>
<li>choose <em>one</em> of the data sets in the document (click on the links there to access them)</li>
<li>decide on some questions of interest</li>
<li>do your analysis in R/SAS/both</li>
<li>write a report with Introduction-Analysis-Conclusion that tells story of your findings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-11-11 13:10: I had (R!) code that would pull all the SAS code chunks out of my (modified) lecture notes! Hence, <a href="sas_lecture_code.sas">up-to-date SAS lecture code</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-11 13:00: the <a href="slides-sas.pdf">SAS slides</a> are updated. Now I have to figure out how to get hold of the SAS code!</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-11 11:45: I modified my <a href="a7.pdf">Assignment 7 solutions</a> slightly because of some comments by the grader. Also, I want to modify my SAS notes a little so that the file access is to things on the web rather than files on my computer (so that you can follow along and get what I did). Also also, I have started work on your final exam.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-09 12:20: My <a href="a7.pdf">Assignment 7 solutions</a>, plus a note that <a href="a8.pdf">Assignment 8</a> is now up. (Assignment 8 is the last assignment.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-08 12:20: I have been hearing about some students getting “unauthorized” when they tried to access Assignment 7. I don’t know what this is, but it looks as if it is intermittent, meaning that “try again later” might work. I haven’t heard about any problems today, so I’m willing to accept any assignments that have been handed in up to now or within the next few minutes. (This should accommodate you if you couldn’t hand it in last night but managed to do so this morning.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-08 12:00 I will shortly be posting my solutions and putting up assignment 8. I think you have everything you need to <em>do</em> assignment 8. To hand it in properly, you need to work through question 2 first. I’ll talk about this briefly in class on Tuesday.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-05 14:30: somebody left their phone behind in class. It’s in my office. If it’s yours, visit my office and let me know (i) which carrier and (ii) what the picture on the lock screen is and it’s yours. (The phone is back with its owner.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-04 13:15: Here is the draft <a href="a8.pdf">Assignment 8</a>. It won’t make any sense to you yet, although having said that, you actually can do question 1 now. The hand-in part of the assignment is short, but you will need to do some preparatory work first, so it’s not quite as short as it looks.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-04 11:30: I decided to leave Assignment 7 as it was. I have a couple of reasons for this: (i) though there are 10 parts, each one is not that complicated, and if you understand what you are doing, the whole thing ought not to take too long; (ii) many of the projects are or can be multiple regressions, and so the techniques here will be useful to you when you do your project; (iii) many multiple regressions follow a process similar to the one in Assignment 7, so having the practice now is useful. Assignment 7 is going up on Quercus.</p></li>
<li>2019-11-04 10:00:
<ul>
<li>when we get to the end of the regression material (Case Study 3 and the regression with categorical variables), it’s time to move off R and onto SAS. So I plan for tomorrow’s lecture to be the last one on R (at least for now), and to start SAS on Thursday, so that the final Assignment 8 can be using SAS. (I might come back to R at the very end of the course, depending on how we’re doing for time.)</li>
<li>I plan to shorten Assignment 7 a little from the draft. That will go up on Quercus this afternoon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-11-01 13:00: we discovered an inconsistency in the grading of 2(c) on the midterm. If you had a low-numbered booklet, you might have received one mark too few. This has now been fixed and uploaded to Quercus.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-01 11:30: <a href="a7.pdf">Draft assignment 7</a>. This is on multiple regression, and a bit long, but you have seen everything you need in lecture.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-01 11:20: <a href="a6.pdf">My solutions</a> to Assignment 6, or at least the coding part thereof. Here is my version of <a href="skin-cream-report.html">a report</a>, and the <a href="skin-cream-report.Rmd">R Markdown document</a> from which it came. I used subheadings in my Analysis section to help the reader keep track.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-11-01 11:15: happy All Saints Day (that’s the day after Halloween). The second-to-last paragraph of <a href="https://www.al.com/living/2013/11/days_of_the_dead_whats_the_dif.html">this</a> explains where Halloween comes from.</p></li>
<li>2019-10-29 12:15:
<ul>
<li><p>for this week’s lectures: simple and multiple regression, as illustrated by the windmill and asphalt examples. After that, a discussion of regression with categorical variables.</p></li>
<li><p>At some point among that, I will be talking about the project, in which you will probably be using ideas from writing reports (assignment 6) and regression/ANOVA/data tidying.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-10-24 16:45: <a href="a6.pdf">Assignment 6</a> is up on <a href="http://q.utoronto.ca/">Quercus</a>. I didn’t change anything from the draft.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-22 16:15: draft <a href="a6.pdf">assignment 6</a>. It’s about writing a report, using some of the data-tidying and data-organizing tools that we’ve seen.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-22 15:30: In response to a question in class: to match upper and lower case in the select-helpers, <code>ignore.case=F</code> in any of <code>starts_with</code>, <code>ends_with</code>, <code>contains</code>, <code>matches</code> is the way to go (for example, <code>select(contains(&quot;tt&quot;, ignore.case=F))</code> to select those columns whose names contain two consecutive <em>lowercase</em> t’s). It’s a double negative: “don’t ignore case”, ie., pay attention to whether the letters are uppercase or lowercase.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-22 14:30: <strong>important</strong>: no tutorial tomorrow, because no assignment. Tutorials begin again on October 30, with assignment 6 due on October 31.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-22 14:25: websites I meant to share in class <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=16125">about BMI</a> and about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_put">shot putting</a>.</p></li>
<li>2019-10-21 21:20: comments on the exam, particularly if the outcome disappointed you:
<ul>
<li>read over your marked exam with <a href="midterm-20199.pdf">my solutions</a>. In the solutions you will often see a grading scheme that says what kind of work I was expecting for what grade. You may have additional comments on your work that indicate something missing or an error you made (or a point you made that was worth something, if you see a checkmark. A checkmark is not necessarily one point.) Each question part has been graded by the same person for all the exams, and they have done their best to be consistent. (I randomly choose an exam to begin with each time, so as to share out any advantages or disadvantages of being at the top or bottom of the pile.)</li>
<li>In my solutions, I have tried to include some mention of the various different ways you could tackle each question.</li>
<li>If you see something on your exam that has been marked not in accordance with the grading scheme (if there is one) or consistently with the things you said (in comparison with my solutions), then you are free to ask for it to be regraded. To do so, send me an email (from your U of T email address) with your name and student number. Say which question you want regraded, and explain briefly why you think the current mark is not correct. If you want your grade to change, you will need to be persuasive. My graders and I do not usually change grades unless there has been a demonstrable mistake. A lot of the grading in this course is based on a grader’s judgement, and it is very likely that if you think a grader judged your work harshly, they judged <em>everyone’s</em> work in the same way. It is the same principle as video referees in sports: if a mistake has been made, the video referee will correct it, but if it is a matter of the referee’s judgement, the video referee will defer to the person on the field. I will forward any regrade requests to the grader who originally graded the work, for consistency. The usual warning that grades can go down as well as up.</li>
<li>If your entire exam grade disappoints you, then you have some work to do.
<ul>
<li>The first thing to do is to read <em>carefully</em> through your graded exam with my solutions. This is, I know, emotionally hard to do, but it is absolutely necessary if you are going to succeed in this course (or any course with exams). Find out where you lost marks. Are there certain bits of subject matter in the course that you really didn’t understand? Did you run out of time? Did I ask about things that you didn’t have notes on? Look for patterns, things that you can take advantage of in the rest of the course.</li>
<li>If you didn’t understand subject matter, you need to go back and work on it again. Do problems, such as the ones in PASIAS. Maybe hide the answers until you’ve given the problem some good honest thought. Do that soon, because there may be stuff coming up that depends on whatever it is that you don’t understand. You will have to put extra time into this course, because you will be catching up on material from earlier that you didn’t understand then, and also learning the new material.</li>
<li>If you ran out of time, think about why. Did you take too long on the first few questions? Did you spend too long looking in your notes for things? In both cases, spending time organizing your notes will pay off, because (i) you will know exactly where to find things and (ii) the process of doing so will remind you of stuff we talked about in class, so that you will be able to call it to mind quicker.</li>
<li>This is not a hard course to succeed in, provided <em>you do the work, yourself</em>. That means setting aside time to sit down in front of a computer and run R Studio, yourself. Learn how it works, and how to solve the kind of problems we run into. There is no substitute for this. Get practice with writing about your code and results. R Notebooks make this very easy. If you need help with study skills generally, <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/aacc/study-skills-services">Academic Advising</a> can help you. If you need help, <em>get help</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-10-21 21:15: exam marks are posted on Quercus. I will shortly be sending you your graded exam. If you can’t find it, look in your email for something from Crowdmark. In a moment, I will be telling you what to do if you have issues with the grading.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-21 21:00: I think I’m happy with the grades. Median 56.5/85=66%, Q3 66/85=78%, Q1 50/85=59%. My <a href="midterm-20199.pdf">final solutions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-21 20:45: finished grading! Time to look over the grades before I release them to you.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-21 17:30: 8(c) is done. Aasha has finished question 4. Going home to eat dinner, then on to the final part.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-21 14:00: If you missed the midterm for a documentable reason, get me the documentation, and you can take the weight of the midterm on the final exam. (I already have about 4.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-21 13:30: I am done 8(b); Aasha is working on 4(a).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-21 12:30: Aasha is here working on question 1. I finally finished 8(a).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 21:00: question 3 done. Taking a break. I may or may not get any further tonight. Current state of <a href="midterm-20199.pdf">my solutions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 19:45: 3(e) done. I went back and checked that I had been consistent in the ones I gave 1 mark. (I was.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 19:15: 3(d) done. It took me a grand total of 11 minutes to go through the (virtual) pile.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 17:45: back. I picked off 1(c), which I knew I would be marking. On to question 3 and/or dinner next.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 15:10: question 7 done. I need a break. Going for a walk in the sunshine.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 14:00: Not quite the speed of light, but 7(c) was pretty fast and is now done. (I did actually have to <em>read</em> what was written, after all.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 13:00: 7(b) was a good bit slower, but is now done. Part (c) I should be able to do at the speed of light, but I need lunch first.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 11:50: raced through 7(a). Marking code is fast.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-20 11:00: back at my desk, and question 6 is done. Also, Bo has done the first half of question 3. As things stand now, I have to do question 7 and 8, the second half of question 3, and I think one bit of question 1.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-19 23:00: 6(c) done. I have no brain left, for tonight at least.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-19 21:55: 6(a) and 6(b) are done. I have added some actual answers (no names attached, of course) that got full marks to my solutions for some of the questions I’m marking. On to 6(c), which may be the last one tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-19 18:00: progress report: question 5 is finished (slowly) by me, and question 2 is finished (quickly) by Bo. <a href="midterm-20199.pdf">My updated solutions</a>. Hungry. Need dinner.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-19 15:10: and so we begin. I have graded 5(a) so far; it looks as if Bo is currently working on 2(d), having done (a) through (c). But then he works faster than I do. Aasha is planning to start her grading on Monday or so. Meanwhile, I am still on campus, and I think it’s time to go home.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-19 13:15: just so that you know: next week (the week of October 21-25) there is <em>no assignment</em> and also <em>no tutorials</em>. Assignment 6 (not quite finished yet) will be due on Oct 31; there will be tutorials again that week.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-19 13:00: your exams are all scanned. We have an online grading system, which means that you will get an online copy of your marked exam back afterwards. I will shortly start my share of the grading, but in the meantime, <a href="midterm-20199.pdf">my solutions</a> and <a href="midterm-20199-f.pdf">the figures</a>. My solutions will get added to as we grade (especially if people do stuff that we weren’t expecting).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-17 21:45: there is some kind of bizarre error on slide 161 of the lecture notes. For now, ignore this slide. The P-value you need, 0.0668 (greater than 0.05 and less than 0.10) is on the previous two slides. (Later: fixed.)</p></li>
<li>2019-10-16 14:30: reminders:
<ul>
<li>midterm exam is <em>Saturday October 19, 9:00-11:00, HLB 101</em> (Highland Hall), the lecture room downstairs from the event centre.</li>
<li>pre-midterm office hours are <em>Thursday October 17</em>, 2:30-4:30 (or earlier if I get there earlier).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-10-15 15:30: (edit 17:30: uploaded.) I will shortly upload a new version of PASIAS that includes <code>pivot_longer</code> and <code>pivot_wider</code> as an alternative, everywhere that <code>gather</code> and <code>spread</code> were before. For you, I recommend picking one and learning it (at least for now). The <code>pivot_</code> functions are the future, if that guides you in your decision. On an exam, you can go either way for full marks (my solutions will have both). Next year I plan to teach only the <code>pivot_</code> versions, but this year you have the opportunity to use either. (Expect to see only <code>pivot_longer</code> and <code>pivot_wider</code> in D29, if I get to my notes in time.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-12 13:30: the <a href="final-20169-s.pdf">2016</a> and <a href="final-20179-s.pdf">2017</a> final exams now have <code>pivot_longer</code> as an alternative to <code>gather</code> (the extra notes are labelled “2019” in the exam solutions). The 2016 final also has some <code>gather</code> code in the Figures, to which I added the <code>pivot_longer</code> equivalent. (In the days when I did R and SAS together, we didn’t get as far as <code>gather</code> by the midterm.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-11 21:00: I think chapter 13 of PASIAS is now updated with <code>pivot_longer</code> everywhere <code>gather</code> was (you will usually see both side by side). I recommend learning <code>pivot_longer</code> rather than <code>gather</code>, since it is more up-to-date and more flexible (in problems <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/tidying-and-selecting-data.html#location-species-and-disease-in-plants">13.6</a> and <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/tidying-and-selecting-data.html#mating-songs-in-crickets">13.7</a> you see some of what it can do), but as far as our course is concerned, I am happy to see either one. You will probably still see <code>gather</code> on the old exams, which I need to check over. I found some typos in PASIAS that I also fixed. If you see more, let me know. There are bound to be some. (They might be typos, or bits of text that make no sense because something went missing or didn’t display properly.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-11 21:00: in the most recently uploaded lecture notes (the slides that are <a href="slides_c32.pdf">here</a> now), the material for the midterm goes up to and including slide 307. I didn’t show you that slide, but it summarizes what I talked about, so it may be useful for you.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-11 15:00: my <a href="a5.pdf">solutions to Assignment 5</a>. There isn’t an Assignment 6 yet (this will be due on October 31). Once we get a bit closer, I’ll figure out what ought to go on this. I am gradually working through PASIAS to put <code>pivot_longer</code> and <code>pivot_wider</code> in as well as <code>gather</code> and <code>spread</code>. I think <em>next</em> year I’ll be teaching the <code>pivot_</code> things only, but you folks got caught in the middle of the transition. (Though I like <code>gather</code>, I think <code>pivot_longer</code> is better, and also more flexible in some ways that we haven’t seen yet. For now, though, you can use whichever you like.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-10 16:00: the exam is off to be printed. I settled on 8 questions on 9 pages worth a total of 85 points. A reminder that you will not have time to waste at the exam, so make sure you organize what you bring, so that you can quickly find what you are looking for. The exam is actually 10 pages long (plus a cover page), because the last page is blank; if you run out of space to write an answer, you can use this last page instead. (Writing on the back of a page is a bad idea because the graders won’t see that.) There will be a box on the front of the exam for you to write your name and student number; this is auto-recognized and matched to the class list, so writing clearly there is a good idea. A strategy tip: flip through the whole exam before you write anything, getting if you can a sense of what each question is about, then start with something you know how to do. There is no obligation to work on the questions in order. Make sure you do as much as possible of what you know well, and if you have to skip anything, let it be something you’re not sure about. If you know how to do question 8, for example, by all means do that first. A good progress guide for my exams is the marks for each part or question; 85 marks is slightly more than one mark every 1.5 minutes. Try not to get too far behind that pace.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-10 14:00: for practice with data tidying, look at Chapter 13 of <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/tidying-and-selecting-data.html#tidying-and-selecting-data">PASIAS</a>. Problems 13.1 and 13.8 are more about selecting and organizing data, the subject of the next lecture after the midterm, so don’t worry about those now. (There is a certain overlap between tidying data, which we did today, and other data organization, which we haven’t talked about yet. When you’re working through the problems in PASIAS, don’t worry about things that look unfamiliar.) The other thing I should say is that the PASIAS problems use <code>gather</code> rather than <code>pivot_longer</code>, at least they do as I write this. I plan to get to these problems next week and include <code>pivot_longer</code> in the code, so that you see how to do it both ways. Either <code>gather</code> or <code>pivot_longer</code> would be good exam answers for problems of this type. I see that I also have some typos that I need to fix.</p></li>
<li>2019-10-10 12:00: pre-midterm office hours <em>Thursday</em> of reading week, 2:30-4:30.</li>
<li>2019-10-09 11:30: some notes:
<ul>
<li>I plan to finish work on your midterm tomorrow afternoon, making a final decision on its length then.</li>
<li>Anything that we cover up to and including tomorrow’s lecture is fair game for the midterm. I will point you to problems in PASIAS about report-writing and tidying data that haven’t appeared on an assignment yet, so you have a chance to practice those.</li>
<li>Looking further ahead: there will be three more assignments, #6 (due Oct 31), #7 (due Nov 7), #8 (due Nov 14). The last assignment is early to allow you time to work on your group project, which I will talk about after the midterm. I will point you to practice problems in PASIAS for material that doesn’t appear on an assignment.</li>
<li>I intend to talk about SAS for something like the last three weeks of the course (which may mean that you won’t get much assignment practice with SAS, but I have practice problems on that for you to work on). The idea is that during those last three weeks we cover (faster) the same statistical material that we do in R, but in SAS. We can do this faster because you are already familiar with the ideas, and just need to learn the coding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-10-08 12:45: just in time to head to class, the updated <a href="slides_c32.pdf">lecture notes</a> are up.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-08 11:45: I am working on new and revised examples for the section on tidying data (which we’ll begin at the end of today or on Thursday). Look out for revised lecture notes, and revised code to go with them.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-07 10:00: on the agenda for this week: writing reports, and (maybe) tidying and organizing data, the start of.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-07 10:00: <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a> is up on Quercus, as amended on Thursday. Here are my solutions to <a href="a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a>. These were supposed to go up on Friday, but I didn’t get to it until now. Sorry.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-04 15:15: I have a first draft of the midterm. It currently has 8 questions worth a total of 91 points, which makes it a little too long. I will be cutting something.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-03 15:30: If you want some practice on the material from today’s lecture, <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/analysis-of-variance.html#analysis-of-variance">Chapter 12 in PASIAS</a> is the place to look. You may not have time to get to it now, but you would definitely benefit from working through it before the midterm.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-03 15:30: You might be happy to learn that I shortened <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a>. The last question now only has four parts. (I left the other three parts in in case you wanted to do them, but you only need to hand in (a) through (d) of the last question.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-03 14:10: That flow chart from today’s lecture:</p></li>

<li>2019-10-01 15:45: some thoughts about the midterm:
<ul>
<li>the exam is open book. You can bring your lecture notes, assignments, my assignment solutions, anything from PASIAS, <em>printed out</em>. (No computers at the exam.) You will not have time at the exam to search through your materials for things, so make sure you spend time organizing what you bring so you know where to find what you’re looking for.</li>
<li>this is a handwritten exam. Be prepared to write, actual words. Calculation will be zero to minimal. If you want to bring a non-programmable non-communicating calculator, be my guest.</li>
<li>You will be asked for R code to do certain tasks on data that I show you, which you will have to write out. (I appreciate that you will not be in front of a computer so you won’t be able to try it and make sure it works.) Attention to detail is key here. If the code won’t work, you’ll lose some points. (On the other hand, if it’s a sensible idea, even with errors, you can expect to get something.)</li>
<li>I will also show you output or graphs and ask you questions about those, or describe situations and ask you questions about that.</li>
<li>Copying stuff verbatim (word for word) out of my notes is very unlikely to be worth any marks. You will need to think about how <em>ideas</em> in what we have studied apply to the data in front of you.</li>
<li>the overall style will be similar to past midterms. So organize your materials and practice with the old midterms, judging how much time you have and where you could save time (eg. by being more organized).</li>
<li>in years before 2018, I did R and SAS together through the course, so on midterms 2017 and before, you will see some SAS questions on the midterm that you won’t see now. This means that we are going somewhat faster through the material than we did in 2017 and before, so you might like to look ahead to old final exams to find more R stuff to practice.</li>
<li>in the “explain briefly” questions I am usually searching for one idea, which you can explain in maybe two well-written sentences. If you write a lot of irrelevant stuff along with a good answer, you may not get all the marks. Learn to be concise and accurate.</li>
<li>I try to write my exams to give you a chance to show me what you know; there are often several different (but equally good) ways to approach a question, which I try to discuss in my solutions. As you have seen on the assignments, I often care more about your logical process than about your specific answer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 21:00: <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/good-citizenship-depends-on-basic-statistical-literacy?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=essay_hum">A nice essay</a> on statistical literacy.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 15:00: in the unlikely event that you care yet, a draft <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a>. It has two questions on it, and is thus a similar length to Assignment 3 (for reasons I discuss below). It is not final yet; I may decide to shorten it some. Expect assignment 6, due after the midterm (target due date Oct 31), to be shorter.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 11:40: on the slate for next week: Mood’s median test (with a bit of preamble on the chi-squared test for independence); analysis of variance, Tukey’s method and some variations on analysis of variance and when to use them. Whatever we get to before reading week is fair game for the midterm.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 11:30: my <a href="a3.pdf">solutions to assignment 3</a>. Also, <a href="a4.pdf">assignment 4</a> is up on Quercus. I am trying to decide how long to make Assignment 5; I can include questions on any of matched pairs, normal quantile plots, Mood’s median test (which we do next week). There is a battle (in my mind) between not making it too long for you, and making it longer to give you more practice for the midterm. I am currently inclined to make it a bit longer to prepare you better for the midterm (this will be the last assignment before the midterm). But we’ll see how it plays out.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-24 11:15: here’s the draft <a href="a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a>. Only one question to hand in, on the sign test and CI for the median (which we’ll do today or Thursday).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-20 18:30: <a href="a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a> is up on Quercus. A warning that this is long, so make sure you allow enough time to do it all. (Assignment 4 will be shorter.) Also, <a href="a2.pdf">my Assignment 2 solutions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 17:30: on the agenda for next week: the rest of the sign test, including my package for running it (which we will learn how to install); the stuff I skipped on confidence intervals vs. tests; confidence interval for the median; matched pairs; normal quantile plot. Or some of that, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 17:00: looking ahead: I have a draft Assignment 4 which I will share with you next week. Some of Assignment 4 will be doable after next Tuesday’s lecture. <a href="a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a> will be due next week, September 26. (I think this one is good to go, with two questions to hand in, one on two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and one on power by simulation.) Assignment 4, which will be due on October 3, I will try to keep to only one question. If the midterm date is good, Assignment 5 will be due on October 10 and I will give you a week off after the midterm (which means you actually get <em>two</em> assignment-free weeks in a row because of reading week). Giving you a week off after the midterm may seem like a magnanimous gesture on my part, but it’s <em>actually</em> self-preservation for me (and the TAs) because we will be busy marking your exams. My usual habit is also to cancel tutorials for that week (for the same reason). I use Crowdmark for exams in my courses; this doesn’t have much impact on you (other than your exam having a QR code on each page), but it means that the exams are graded online, the marks are added up automatically, and you get your marked exam back without you having to come to my office to get it. (You also get your grade quicker.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 13:35: I made a few small changes to the <a href="slides_c32.pdf">lecture notes</a>. You might like to download a new copy.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 13:30: we have a <strong>tentative</strong> date for the midterm: Saturday October 19, 9:00-11:00 (am), HLB 101 (in Highland Hall). This is the Saturday at the end of reading week (which sucks as an exam day, but it’s what we have), so I will be having office hours during reading week (which I will advertise). A reminder that this date is <em>tentative</em> and may change. I will endeavour to find out when it is final. (We don’t have very many rooms on this campus, so what can happen is that if one exam has to be moved, then a whole bunch of other exams have to move to accommodate it.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-17 00:25: all right, so the website problems are now fixed. All the assignment links from September 12 and on (to assignment 1 solutions and 2 and 3 questions) now work. I don’t quite know why they didn’t before, but I now have a simpler way of arranging things that should be less prone to external problems and easier for me to maintain. The old exam pages should now work; I had made an embarrassingly stupid error, linking to <em>files with the wrong names</em>, so in retrospect it was entirely unsurprising that the files could not be found. (I thought I checked this before, but, y’know, summer.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-16 23:55: the links to the assignments stopped working. I think the link to assignment 2 is back in business (the link now on Quercus certainly works), but as I write I’m not sure about the assignment 1 solutions. (These appear to be just the questions, not the answers. Mysterious.) Also, the old exam links now appear to be broken. I will look at those in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-16 17:30: on the agenda for this week: power of tests; tests vs. confidence intervals; (if we get to it) the sign test.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-16 17:30: my solutions to <a href="a1.pdf">Assignment 1</a>. Also, <a href="a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a> is up on Quercus. I seem to have taken my time getting to those. Sorry.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 16:05: here’s the draft <a href="a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a>. You can do questions 1 and 3 now, should you be looking for something to do.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 15:00: I’ve been thinking about assignments 2 and 3. We have actually done as of today the two-sample testing that is currently the first hand-in question on assignment 3; I could move it to assignment 2, but I don’t want to make that too long. This means that there will probably be <em>two</em> hand-in questions on assignment 3, one on two-sample testing and one on power (which is coming up in class next week). One of these assignments is going to be longer, but I think I would prefer it to be number 3, to give you a chance to get used to everything first. Thus, expect assignment 2 to be (almost exactly) the same as the draft that went up this week. There will be a hand-in for Assignment 2 on Quercus on about Friday. (I am trying to minimize the chances of people handing an assignment in in the wrong place.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 14:55: My solutions to assignment 1 will be posted here on Monday morning. I have tried to anticipate the various possibilities of things you might do, but the nature of this course is that you might be able to find a different but still reasonable answer to the question. If it satisfies the grader, it’s good even if it’s not the same as what I did.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 11:00: reminder: today’s class, and all the remaining Thursday lectures, are in <strong>IC 130</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-09 17:00: on the agenda for this week: numerical summaries (short), the first part of statistical inference (long). I’m aiming to show you the one-sample inference stuff in R this week (that is, one-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, for estimating a population mean). You ought to be very familiar with the ideas here, but I want to make sure that you really are, along of course with how to code it in R.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-09 16:45: draft of <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/assgt_data/a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a>, which will be due on Thursday 19th.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-09 13:00: The Thursday lecture will now be in <em>IC 130</em> (effective now, for the rest of the semester). You are likely to find some other class happening in the old room.</p></li>
<li>2019-09-09 12:45: I’ve been looking at the wait list, and have chosen to admit three more students. My criteria were: must be in the Statistics Applied Minor program, must not simultaneously be in any conflicting program (such as Statistics Major or Minor), <em>and</em> must have joined the wait list on or before Wednesday of last week. All of those. My reasons for doing it this way:
<ul>
<li>the course is required for the Statistics Applied Minor, so I need to give these students priority as far as I can.</li>
<li>students simultaneously in the Applied Minor and some other Statistics program need to choose <em>one</em> of those programs, because the programs require courses that are exclusions to each other (and therefore such students run the risk of not having enough distinct credits to graduate). This will be expressly forbidden as of next year.</li>
<li>Students in other Statistics programs (Specialist, Major, Minor) <em>do not get program credit</em> for this course, so there is no way I am admitting such students to the course.</li>
<li>Students in eg. Math Specialist can theoretically take this course (logically, they shouldn’t be able to, which will be fixed for next year), but I have to give the Applied Minor students preference. (For Math Specialist students, the course is elective, not required.)</li>
<li>I want students in other disciplines who are on the wait list to be able to take this course if it looks as if they will be able to benefit from it, but this year there are too many Applied Minor students to be able to admit any students in other disciplines off the wait list. I feel bad about this, but unfortunately it’s the way it is.</li>
<li>If you joined the wait list some time after the course has already begun, I question how serious you are about really wanting to get into it. (If you are in the third or fourth year, your registration window opens earlier, something you would do well to take advantage of when choosing programs and courses.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-09-05 10:20: STAC32 only offers program credit for the Statistics <em>Applied</em> Minor. There are 10 people currently enrolled in the course who are in the Statistics Major/Minor/Specialist programs. A second warning to those people that you <em>will not</em> get program credit for STAC32. This applies no matter when you enrolled in your subject post. If you have spoken to me and understand the consequences, you may stay in the course, but otherwise your best option is to withdraw from the course. (This also applies if you are in these programs and are on the wait list; even if you get in, you won’t get program credit for the course.) If this is you: there are some people on the wait list who would benefit from taking the course, and <em>you are preventing them from getting in</em>.</p></li>
<li>2019-09-04 20:45: I just took a quick look through the “Assignment 0” that were “handed in” (that is way too many quotes). If you got a “yep” comment from me, I saw the HTML output from the mtcars analysis. If I didn’t see that, I tried to direct you towards what would work for next time.</li>
<li>2019-09-04 20:00: here is <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/a1.pdf">assignment 1</a>. This will be due on Thursday September 12 at 11:59pm. I am hoping to get through everything you need in tomorrow’s lecture (we have to talk about reading in files and drawing graphs). The general principle is supposed to be that you’ll be able to do each assignment after the preceding Thursday’s lecture. Next week’s tutorial is a chance for you to work on Assignment 1, either the hand-in problem or any of the related things in <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">PASIAS</a> (see problem 1 on assignment 1). There is an Assignment 1 link on Quercus where you can submit your Assignment 1 when it is done.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 17:30: as we solve one problem, another comes up: if you are registered for STAD29 and STAC53, you get a message on Degree Explorer that these courses are exclusions, which they are not. This will get fixed in the next round of curriculum changes, and so will be in place in time for you to graduate. Thus, don’t worry about this now.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 16:00: the Quercus page is up. There isn’t much there yet (apart from a link to here), but it is up.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 15:00: as I didn’t get the chance to say at the end of lecture today: first tutorial <em>tomorrow</em>.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 11:15: first lecture is <em>today</em> and first tutorial is <em>tomorrow</em>.</li>
<li>2019-08-29 14:50: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M9abrkPN7-tmujhcCuUa2DlnxApfDBIKZlNgBRq-amM/edit#slide=id.p3">How to write an email to your instructor</a>. (This applies to any course you might be taking; adjust the instructor’s name and course code appropriately.)</li>
<li>2019-08-26 13:30: Course info:
<ul>
<li>lectures Tuesday 1:00-2:00pm in MW 170, Thursday 12:00-1:00pm in SW 319.</li>
<li>tutorial one of Wednesday 3:00-4:00pm, 4:00-5:00pm in BV 498.</li>
<li>tutorials start in <em>week 1</em>. In the first tutorial you will work on <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/assgt_data/a0.pdf">“Assignment 0”</a>.</li>
<li>office hours in IC 471 after class on Tuesday (14:00-15:30) and before class on Thursday (10:30-11:30).</li>
<li>course outline in first few pages of <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/slides_c32.pdf">here</a>. When you come to the first lecture, you will learn why I arrange things as I do.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-08-26 13:30: Welcome to STAC32! This website should now be live. Let me know if anything is not working.</p></li>
