<p>Welcome to the home page for STAC32. This is the place to look for all things course-related (notes, assignments, announcements etc., linked above) except for assignment hand-ins and marks, which will be on <a href="http://q.utoronto.ca">Quercus</a>.</p>
<p>In this course, we learn R (and later SAS), and how to use this software for data organization and to apply statistical methods that you (mostly) already know.</p>
<p>This is an applied course. Expect to be describing the process by which you got your answers, and explaining what the answers mean <em>in the context of the data you are working with</em>: that is to say, using your language skills as well as your statistical skills. In real life, people do Statistics to make decisions or inform actions, and you will be expected to play your full part in that process, both in this course and in your statistical future.</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>2019-10-07 10:00: <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a> is up on Quercus, as amended on Thursday. Here are my solutions to <a href="a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a>. These were supposed to go up on Friday, but I didn’t get to it until now. Sorry.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-04 15:15: I have a first draft of the midterm. It currently has 8 questions worth a total of 91 points, which makes it a little too long. I will be cutting something.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-03 15:30: If you want some practice on the material from today’s lecture, <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/analysis-of-variance.html#analysis-of-variance">Chapter 12 in PASIAS</a> is the place to look. You may not have time to get to it now, but you would definitely benefit from working through it before the midterm.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-03 15:30: You might be happy to learn that I shortened <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a>. The last question now only has four parts. (I left the other three parts in in case you wanted to do them, but you only need to hand in (a) through (d) of the last question.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-10-03 14:10: That flow chart from today’s lecture:</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="htmlwidget-5b55b540b40fcb5a377a" style="width:1152px;height:384px;" class="DiagrammeR html-widget"></div>

<p>This is a thing called an HTMLwidget, which means I just need to include the R code chunk that produced it in the webpage, play with the sizing, and it will appear. Feel free to screenshot it for printing (I think it will fit on one sheet of paper in landscape, and still be readable).</p>
<ul>
<li>2019-10-01 15:45: some thoughts about the midterm:
<ul>
<li>the exam is open book. You can bring your lecture notes, assignments, my assignment solutions, anything from PASIAS, <em>printed out</em>. (No computers at the exam.) You will not have time at the exam to search through your materials for things, so make sure you spend time organizing what you bring so you know where to find what you’re looking for.</li>
<li>this is a handwritten exam. Be prepared to write, actual words. Calculation will be zero to minimal. If you want to bring a non-programmable non-communicating calculator, be my guest.</li>
<li>You will be asked for R code to do certain tasks on data that I show you, which you will have to write out. (I appreciate that you will not be in front of a computer so you won’t be able to try it and make sure it works.) Attention to detail is key here. If the code won’t work, you’ll lose some points. (On the other hand, if it’s a sensible idea, even with errors, you can expect to get something.)</li>
<li>I will also show you output or graphs and ask you questions about those, or describe situations and ask you questions about that.</li>
<li>Copying stuff verbatim (word for word) out of my notes is very unlikely to be worth any marks. You will need to think about how <em>ideas</em> in what we have studied apply to the data in front of you.</li>
<li>the overall style will be similar to past midterms. So organize your materials and practice with the old midterms, judging how much time you have and where you could save time (eg. by being more organized).</li>
<li>in years before 2018, I did R and SAS together through the course, so on midterms 2017 and before, you will see some SAS questions on the midterm that you won’t see now. This means that we are going somewhat faster through the material than we did in 2017 and before, so you might like to look ahead to old final exams to find more R stuff to practice.</li>
<li>in the “explain briefly” questions I am usually searching for one idea, which you can explain in maybe two well-written sentences. If you write a lot of irrelevant stuff along with a good answer, you may not get all the marks. Learn to be concise and accurate.</li>
<li>I try to write my exams to give you a chance to show me what you know; there are often several different (but equally good) ways to approach a question, which I try to discuss in my solutions. As you have seen on the assignments, I often care more about your logical process than about your specific answer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 21:00: <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/good-citizenship-depends-on-basic-statistical-literacy?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=essay_hum">A nice essay</a> on statistical literacy.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 15:00: in the unlikely event that you care yet, a draft <a href="a5.pdf">Assignment 5</a>. It has two questions on it, and is thus a similar length to Assignment 3 (for reasons I discuss below). It is not final yet; I may decide to shorten it some. Expect assignment 6, due after the midterm (target due date Oct 31), to be shorter.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 11:40: on the slate for next week: Mood’s median test (with a bit of preamble on the chi-squared test for independence); analysis of variance, Tukey’s method and some variations on analysis of variance and when to use them. Whatever we get to before reading week is fair game for the midterm.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-27 11:30: my <a href="a3.pdf">solutions to assignment 3</a>. Also, <a href="a4.pdf">assignment 4</a> is up on Quercus. I am trying to decide how long to make Assignment 5; I can include questions on any of matched pairs, normal quantile plots, Mood’s median test (which we do next week). There is a battle (in my mind) between not making it too long for you, and making it longer to give you more practice for the midterm. I am currently inclined to make it a bit longer to prepare you better for the midterm (this will be the last assignment before the midterm). But we’ll see how it plays out.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-24 11:15: here’s the draft <a href="a4.pdf">Assignment 4</a>. Only one question to hand in, on the sign test and CI for the median (which we’ll do today or Thursday).</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-20 18:30: <a href="a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a> is up on Quercus. A warning that this is long, so make sure you allow enough time to do it all. (Assignment 4 will be shorter.) Also, <a href="a2.pdf">my Assignment 2 solutions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 17:30: on the agenda for next week: the rest of the sign test, including my package for running it (which we will learn how to install); the stuff I skipped on confidence intervals vs. tests; confidence interval for the median; matched pairs; normal quantile plot. Or some of that, at least.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 17:00: looking ahead: I have a draft Assignment 4 which I will share with you next week. Some of Assignment 4 will be doable after next Tuesday’s lecture. <a href="a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a> will be due next week, September 26. (I think this one is good to go, with two questions to hand in, one on two-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and one on power by simulation.) Assignment 4, which will be due on October 3, I will try to keep to only one question. If the midterm date is good, Assignment 5 will be due on October 10 and I will give you a week off after the midterm (which means you actually get <em>two</em> assignment-free weeks in a row because of reading week). Giving you a week off after the midterm may seem like a magnanimous gesture on my part, but it’s <em>actually</em> self-preservation for me (and the TAs) because we will be busy marking your exams. My usual habit is also to cancel tutorials for that week (for the same reason). I use Crowdmark for exams in my courses; this doesn’t have much impact on you (other than your exam having a QR code on each page), but it means that the exams are graded online, the marks are added up automatically, and you get your marked exam back without you having to come to my office to get it. (You also get your grade quicker.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 13:35: I made a few small changes to the <a href="slides_c32.pdf">lecture notes</a>. You might like to download a new copy.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-19 13:30: we have a <strong>tentative</strong> date for the midterm: Saturday October 19, 9:00-11:00 (am), HLB 101 (in Highland Hall). This is the Saturday at the end of reading week (which sucks as an exam day, but it’s what we have), so I will be having office hours during reading week (which I will advertise). A reminder that this date is <em>tentative</em> and may change. I will endeavour to find out when it is final. (We don’t have very many rooms on this campus, so what can happen is that if one exam has to be moved, then a whole bunch of other exams have to move to accommodate it.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-17 00:25: all right, so the website problems are now fixed. All the assignment links from September 12 and on (to assignment 1 solutions and 2 and 3 questions) now work. I don’t quite know why they didn’t before, but I now have a simpler way of arranging things that should be less prone to external problems and easier for me to maintain. The old exam pages should now work; I had made an embarrassingly stupid error, linking to <em>files with the wrong names</em>, so in retrospect it was entirely unsurprising that the files could not be found. (I thought I checked this before, but, y’know, summer.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-16 23:55: the links to the assignments stopped working. I think the link to assignment 2 is back in business (the link now on Quercus certainly works), but as I write I’m not sure about the assignment 1 solutions. (These appear to be just the questions, not the answers. Mysterious.) Also, the old exam links now appear to be broken. I will look at those in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-16 17:30: on the agenda for this week: power of tests; tests vs. confidence intervals; (if we get to it) the sign test.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-16 17:30: my solutions to <a href="a1.pdf">Assignment 1</a>. Also, <a href="a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a> is up on Quercus. I seem to have taken my time getting to those. Sorry.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 16:05: here’s the draft <a href="a3.pdf">Assignment 3</a>. You can do questions 1 and 3 now, should you be looking for something to do.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 15:00: I’ve been thinking about assignments 2 and 3. We have actually done as of today the two-sample testing that is currently the first hand-in question on assignment 3; I could move it to assignment 2, but I don’t want to make that too long. This means that there will probably be <em>two</em> hand-in questions on assignment 3, one on two-sample testing and one on power (which is coming up in class next week). One of these assignments is going to be longer, but I think I would prefer it to be number 3, to give you a chance to get used to everything first. Thus, expect assignment 2 to be (almost exactly) the same as the draft that went up this week. There will be a hand-in for Assignment 2 on Quercus on about Friday. (I am trying to minimize the chances of people handing an assignment in in the wrong place.)</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 14:55: My solutions to assignment 1 will be posted here on Monday morning. I have tried to anticipate the various possibilities of things you might do, but the nature of this course is that you might be able to find a different but still reasonable answer to the question. If it satisfies the grader, it’s good even if it’s not the same as what I did.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-12 11:00: reminder: today’s class, and all the remaining Thursday lectures, are in <strong>IC 130</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-09 17:00: on the agenda for this week: numerical summaries (short), the first part of statistical inference (long). I’m aiming to show you the one-sample inference stuff in R this week (that is, one-sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, for estimating a population mean). You ought to be very familiar with the ideas here, but I want to make sure that you really are, along of course with how to code it in R.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-09 16:45: draft of <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/assgt_data/a2.pdf">Assignment 2</a>, which will be due on Thursday 19th.</p></li>
<li><p>2019-09-09 13:00: The Thursday lecture will now be in <em>IC 130</em> (effective now, for the rest of the semester). You are likely to find some other class happening in the old room.</p></li>
<li>2019-09-09 12:45: I’ve been looking at the wait list, and have chosen to admit three more students. My criteria were: must be in the Statistics Applied Minor program, must not simultaneously be in any conflicting program (such as Statistics Major or Minor), <em>and</em> must have joined the wait list on or before Wednesday of last week. All of those. My reasons for doing it this way:
<ul>
<li>the course is required for the Statistics Applied Minor, so I need to give these students priority as far as I can.</li>
<li>students simultaneously in the Applied Minor and some other Statistics program need to choose <em>one</em> of those programs, because the programs require courses that are exclusions to each other (and therefore such students run the risk of not having enough distinct credits to graduate). This will be expressly forbidden as of next year.</li>
<li>Students in other Statistics programs (Specialist, Major, Minor) <em>do not get program credit</em> for this course, so there is no way I am admitting such students to the course.</li>
<li>Students in eg. Math Specialist can theoretically take this course (logically, they shouldn’t be able to, which will be fixed for next year), but I have to give the Applied Minor students preference. (For Math Specialist students, the course is elective, not required.)</li>
<li>I want students in other disciplines who are on the wait list to be able to take this course if it looks as if they will be able to benefit from it, but this year there are too many Applied Minor students to be able to admit any students in other disciplines off the wait list. I feel bad about this, but unfortunately it’s the way it is.</li>
<li>If you joined the wait list some time after the course has already begun, I question how serious you are about really wanting to get into it. (If you are in the third or fourth year, your registration window opens earlier, something you would do well to take advantage of when choosing programs and courses.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>2019-09-05 10:20: STAC32 only offers program credit for the Statistics <em>Applied</em> Minor. There are 10 people currently enrolled in the course who are in the Statistics Major/Minor/Specialist programs. A second warning to those people that you <em>will not</em> get program credit for STAC32. This applies no matter when you enrolled in your subject post. If you have spoken to me and understand the consequences, you may stay in the course, but otherwise your best option is to withdraw from the course. (This also applies if you are in these programs and are on the wait list; even if you get in, you won’t get program credit for the course.) If this is you: there are some people on the wait list who would benefit from taking the course, and <em>you are preventing them from getting in</em>.</p></li>
<li>2019-09-04 20:45: I just took a quick look through the “Assignment 0” that were “handed in” (that is way too many quotes). If you got a “yep” comment from me, I saw the HTML output from the mtcars analysis. If I didn’t see that, I tried to direct you towards what would work for next time.</li>
<li>2019-09-04 20:00: here is <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/a1.pdf">assignment 1</a>. This will be due on Thursday September 12 at 11:59pm. I am hoping to get through everything you need in tomorrow’s lecture (we have to talk about reading in files and drawing graphs). The general principle is supposed to be that you’ll be able to do each assignment after the preceding Thursday’s lecture. Next week’s tutorial is a chance for you to work on Assignment 1, either the hand-in problem or any of the related things in <a href="http://ritsokiguess.site/pasias/">PASIAS</a> (see problem 1 on assignment 1). There is an Assignment 1 link on Quercus where you can submit your Assignment 1 when it is done.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 17:30: as we solve one problem, another comes up: if you are registered for STAD29 and STAC53, you get a message on Degree Explorer that these courses are exclusions, which they are not. This will get fixed in the next round of curriculum changes, and so will be in place in time for you to graduate. Thus, don’t worry about this now.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 16:00: the Quercus page is up. There isn’t much there yet (apart from a link to here), but it is up.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 15:00: as I didn’t get the chance to say at the end of lecture today: first tutorial <em>tomorrow</em>.</li>
<li>2019-09-03 11:15: first lecture is <em>today</em> and first tutorial is <em>tomorrow</em>.</li>
<li>2019-08-29 14:50: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M9abrkPN7-tmujhcCuUa2DlnxApfDBIKZlNgBRq-amM/edit#slide=id.p3">How to write an email to your instructor</a>. (This applies to any course you might be taking; adjust the instructor’s name and course code appropriately.)</li>
